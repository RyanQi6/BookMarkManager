# Bookmark Manager

A user is trying to reorganize his browsers bookmarks.The user is currently using both Safari, Chrome and Firefox and over the time has collected thousands of bookmarks in each of them.The problem is that no single browser has all bookmarks, some are duplicated across multiple browsers and some link to the same page but the link is slightly different.Because of that the user asked us to write a program that process these files and return a return a consolidate list of all bookmarks in groups of related links, sorted by preference. See example input/output below
